<p>So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? I was part of something special. Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. Did he just throw my cat out of the window?
</p>
<p>I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. Just my luck, no ice. Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance.

<p>What do they got in there? King Kong? We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore! So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs?
